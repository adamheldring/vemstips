# WHO'S TURN?

## A small app for a big problem...
### ...who's turn is it this week?

:green_heart: This is a very basic website that might not be all that impressive at first glance but I hold it very dear and I actively use it every week. For me it’s a great example of how a little code can really make your life easier. 

:soccer: Every week – my dad, my brother and I take turns placing a bet on the Saturday soccer games. And then we all follow the games, cheer and complain via chat and make jokes about each others teams. Classic family stuff I guess and a great way to keep in touch no matter what else is going on that weekend. 

:money_with_wings: We’ve been doing this for years and every week there was always a big fuzz about who’s turn it is to place the bets. So at a certain point, I threw together this basic but tremendously useful website that just displays the name of whoever is supposed to place the bet this week and just for flavor it also counts down the days and turns red on game day.

:triangular_flag_on_post: *Also, fair warning... since it's made by me for my closest family, the few words needed on this website are in Swedish.*
