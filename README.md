# WHO'S TURN?

## A SMALL APP FOR A BIG PROBLEM... WHO'S TURN IS IT THIS WEEK?

### ORDER ROTATION TRACKER BUILT IN PURE VANILLA JAVASCRIPT, HTML AND CSS.
ðŸ’» Straight-forward and useful single-purpose order rotation tracker app that keeps track of a list of players and states who's turn it is this week. Just for flavor it also counts down the days and turns red on game day. Built in pure vanilla JavaScript.

ðŸ’š This might be a simple website but I hold it very dear and I actively use it every week. For me it's a great example of how a little code can really make your life easier. Every week â€“ my dad, my brother and I take turns placing bets on the Saturday soccer games. Then we all follow the games, cheer and make fun of each others teams via chat. Classic family stuff I guess and a great way to keep in touch no matter what else is going on that weekend. But every week there was always a big fuzz about whoâ€™s turn it really was to place the bets. Until I finally made this little app to settle the question once and for all.
